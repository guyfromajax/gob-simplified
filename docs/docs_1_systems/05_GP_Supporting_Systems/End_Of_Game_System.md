## End of Game System ✅ **COMPLETE** (January 2025)

**Base Constants**

1. **Game Completion Trigger**: Q4 ends (or overtime if applicable)
2. **Completion Detection**: `quarter === 4` and game is finalized
3. **Navigation Parameters**:
   - `gameId` - Game document ID
   - `mode` - Game mode: 'single', 'tournament', or 'franchise'
   - `tournamentId` - Tournament ID (for tournament mode only)
   - `franchiseId` - Franchise ID (for franchise mode only)
   - `teamId` - Team ID (ObjectId) for navigation anchor
   - `finalScore` - Final score object with homeTeam, awayTeam, homeScore, awayScore
4. **Command Center URLs**:
   - Tournament Mode: `/static/tournament.html?tournament_id={id}&team_id={id}`
   - Franchise Mode: `/static/franchise-command-center.html?franchise_id={id}&team_id={id}`
   - Single Game Mode: `/static/mode-select.html`
5. **Key Files**:
   - `FrontEnd/static/js/phaser/gameScene.js` - Detects game completion, calls completion popup
   - `FrontEnd/static/js/phaser/utils/gameCompletionPopup.js` - Creates completion popup, constructs navigation URLs
   - `FrontEnd/static/box-score.js` - Handles "Go To Locker Room" button navigation
   - `BackEnd/api/api.py` - ObjectId serialization for tournament/franchise endpoints

**End of Game System Flow (6 Steps)**

1. **Game Completion Detection**: Game completes when Q4 ends (or overtime), detected in `gameScene.js` when `quarter === 4` and game is finalized
2. **Backend Game Finalization** (Franchise Mode Only): 
   - Frontend calls `/franchise/save-result` endpoint
   - Player stats are finalized via `stat_updater.finalize_game()`
   - **Team attributes are updated** based on game performance (win/loss, score differential, etc.)
   - Updated team attributes are saved to `franchise.franchise_teams.{team_id}` and reflected in the game's box score
3. **Completion Popup Display**: Shows final score, "Box Score" button, and "Go To Locker Room" button with all navigation parameters
4. **Navigation Anchor Preservation**: Preserves complete navigation anchor set (mode, doc_id, team_id) for seamless return to command center
5. **Box Score Navigation**: User can navigate to Box Score page with all context parameters preserved (box score reflects updated team attributes)
6. **Command Center Navigation**: User can navigate to appropriate Command Center (Tournament, Franchise, or Mode Select) with complete navigation context

**Long Form Documentation**

### Overview

The End of Game System handles game completion, displays final scores, and provides navigation to the Box Score page and appropriate Command Center (Tournament, Franchise, or Mode Select for Single Game).

### Game Completion Flow

**Trigger:**
- Game completes when Q4 ends (or overtime if applicable)
- Detected in `gameScene.js` when `quarter === 4` and game is finalized

**Completion Popup:**
- **Location:** `FrontEnd/static/js/phaser/utils/gameCompletionPopup.js`
- **Display:** Shows final score, "Box Score" button, and "Go To Locker Room" button
- **Parameters Passed:**
  - `gameId` - Game document ID
  - `mode` - Game mode: 'single', 'tournament', or 'franchise'
  - `tournamentId` - Tournament ID (for tournament mode only)
  - `franchiseId` - Franchise ID (for franchise mode only)
  - `teamId` - Team ID (ObjectId) for navigation anchor
  - `finalScore` - Final score object with homeTeam, awayTeam, homeScore, awayScore

### Navigation Anchor Preservation (SS&S - January 2025)

**✅ Complete Navigation Anchor Set:** When a game completes, the completion popup preserves all three navigation parameters:
1. **`mode`** (franchise/tournament/single) - Which collection/endpoints to use
2. **`doc_id`** (franchise_id/tournament_id) - Which document within that collection
3. **`team_id`** (ObjectId string) - Which team within that document (user's team)

**Implementation Flow:**
- **`bootGame.js`:** Reads `team_id` from URL params (or `home_id`/`away_id` fallback), passes to game scene via `sceneData`
- **`gameScene.js`:** Stores `teamId` from scene data, passes it to completion popup when game ends
- **`gameCompletionPopup.js`:** Constructs command center URLs with complete navigation anchor set:
  ```javascript
  // Tournament mode example
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  if (tournamentId) params.set('tournament_id', tournamentId);
  if (teamId) params.set('team_id', teamId);  // ✅ Preserve navigation anchor
  lockerRoomUrl = `/static/tournament.html?${params.toString()}`;
  ```

**Benefits:**
- **No Fallback Needed:** Prevents fallback to `/tournament/active?user_team_id=...` which requires ObjectId serialization
- **Complete Context:** All three navigation parameters preserved for seamless return to command center
- **Consistent Pattern:** Matches navigation anchor preservation pattern used throughout the application

### Box Score Navigation

**Box Score URL Construction:**
- **Location:** `gameCompletionPopup.js` (lines 59-64)
- **Parameters Included:**
  - `game_id` - Game document ID
  - `home` - Home team name
  - `away` - Away team name
  - **✅ SS&S (January 2025):** Also includes `mode`, `tournament_id`, `franchise_id`, and `team_id` for proper navigation from Box Score page

**Box Score "Go To Locker Room" Button:**
- **Location:** `FrontEnd/static/box-score.js` - `setupLockerRoomButton()` function
- **Navigation Logic (Priority Order):**
  1. **Mode Parameter (Highest Priority):** If `mode` is set in URL params, use it directly
  2. **ID Parameters:** Check for `tournament_id` or `franchise_id` in URL params
  3. **LocalStorage (Last Resort):** Only check localStorage if URL params are not available (for backward compatibility)
- **Command Center URLs:**
  - **Tournament Mode:** `/static/tournament.html?tournament_id={id}&team_id={id}`
  - **Franchise Mode:** `/static/franchise-command-center.html?franchise_id={id}&team_id={id}`
  - **Single Game Mode:** `/static/mode-select.html`

**Key Fix (January 2025):**
- Box Score page now receives `mode`, `tournament_id`, `franchise_id`, and `team_id` in URL params
- Navigation logic prioritizes URL parameters over localStorage to prevent stale data issues
- Franchise mode uses correct path: `/static/franchise-command-center.html` (not `/franchise/command-center`)

### Backend ObjectId Serialization

- **`/tournament/active` endpoint:** Now serializes all ObjectIds in nested structures using `jsonable_encoder(doc, custom_encoder={ObjectId: str})`
- **Consistent with `/tournament/state`:** Both endpoints use the same serialization pattern
- **Prevents 500 Errors:** Ensures nested ObjectIds (e.g., in `teams` collection) are properly serialized for JSON response

### Games Collection Structure

**Game Document Storage:**
- Game documents are stored in the `games` collection (standalone documents, not nested in franchise/tournament documents)
- **Team Identification Fields:** Game documents use `home_team_id` and `away_team_id` fields (team_id strings like "XAVIEN"), NOT `team1_id` / `team2_id`
- **Teams Object:** The `teams` object is keyed by `team_id` strings (e.g., `teams["XAVIEN"]`), matching the `home_team_id` / `away_team_id` values
- **Plays Data:** Plays data with `game_stats` (times_run, successes) is stored in `teams[team_id]["plays"]`

**Key Fix (January 2025):**
- Scouting report queries were updated to use `home_team_id` / `away_team_id` fields instead of non-existent `team1_id` / `team2_id` fields
- Queries now match against `team_id` strings (like "XAVIEN") instead of ObjectId strings
