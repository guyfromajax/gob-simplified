# Animation System Overview

This document gives incoming contributors a concise tour of the new front-end
animation stack for **GOB**. It covers the architectural goals, the current
state of the migration, and the major components you will work with while
stabilising the Possession Runner and surrounding flows.

## Goals

- **Deterministic timelines** – drive every possession strictly from backend
  timestamps so replays, debugging, and automated tests are repeatable.
- **Single orchestration path** – replace ad-hoc tween chains with a single
  runner that controls the finite-state machine (FSM), ball ownership, and
  sprite motion.
- **Progressive rollout** – keep the legacy animation path available behind
  `window.FEATURE_POSSESSION_RUNNER` so QA/gameplay can fall back while we port
  additional scenarios.

## Migration Plan (snapshot)

1. **Normalize backend data** into deterministic action graphs.
   - `FrontEnd/static/js/phaser/animation/possession/normalizeTurn.js`
   - Already landed; generates frame-by-frame positions, passes, and terminal
     metadata.
2. **PossessionRunner** consumes normalized graphs, schedules tweens on a
   Phaser timeline, and emits canonical events.
   - `FrontEnd/static/js/phaser/animation/possession/PossessionRunner.js`
   - Implementation is present; still tuning timings, FSM transitions, and
     timeline creation so freezes don’t occur.
3. **Centralise FSM control** around the runner for rebounds/fast breaks.
   - Current focus once runner stability improves.
4. **Port remaining flows** (fast breaks, offensive rebounds) to the runner
   path.
5. **Add diagnostics** (DEBUG_ANIM hooks, teleport detection, etc.).
   - Many hooks exist; we continue to expand them as issues surface.

## Key Modules

- **PossessionRunner** – orchestrates half-court possessions, manages ball
  ownership, queues player tweens, and transitions the FSM. Emits
  `possessionRunner:*` events when `DEBUG_ANIM` is true.
- **Timeline factory** – `animationTimeline.js` produces a Phaser timeline when
  available, falling back to `timelinePolyfill.js` for test environments.
- **Ball helpers** – `ballManager.js` handles passes, rebounds, and shot arcs,
  and integrates with the runner via injected helper callbacks.
- **Fast break / inbound adapters** – legacy systems still handle special
  flows; we’re gradually routing them through the runner or compatible
  timelines.

## Current Challenges

- **Timeline fallback** – on some builds Phaser’s tween manager does not expose
  `createTimeline`, so we fall back to the polyfill. This causes choppy motion
  and can deadlock if helper promises never resolve. Short-term plan: detect
  the correct tween plugin (`scene.sys.tweens`) and prefer it before the
  polyfill.
- **FSM noise** – duplicate `ShotAttempt` transitions and “duplicate possession
  change” warnings indicate the runner and legacy helpers are both emitting
  state changes. We’ve added guards to skip redundant transitions, but more
  cleanup is needed as we centralise control.
- **Telemetry** – instrumentation now reports timeline steps, pending helper
  counts, and delay scheduling, which helps diagnose freezes. Continue to use
  `DEBUG_ANIM` when testing.

## Getting Started

1. Enable debug flags:
   ```js
   window.DEBUG_ANIM = true;
   window.FEATURE_POSSESSION_RUNNER = true;
   ```
2. Run a possession and watch the console for `possessionRunner:*` events,
   timeline warnings, and FSM transitions.
3. If animation freezes, capture the current scene’s tween capabilities to
   confirm whether the native timeline is available.
4. Iterate on the PossessionRunner/timeline factory to keep the timeline
   running exclusively through Phaser’s tween manager.

This overview should help new developers orient themselves quickly. Dive into
the files listed above, keep `DEBUG_ANIM` running, and feel free to expand this
document as the migration advances.
