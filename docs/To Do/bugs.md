1. Playcall Override During Opening Tip Sequence -- When a user selects a playcall override during the opening tip sequence (before the game is initialized), the play is highlighted in the playcall center UI but the override never reaches the backend. The frontend `setPlaycallOverride()` function blocks the API call because `game_id` is `null` at that point (the game hasn't been created yet via `/api/simulate-quarter`). The override only works after the first turn is simulated and `game_id` becomes available. **Solution:** Either queue the override and send it after game initialization, or defer the `game_id` check until the first turn is simulated.

## Fixed Bugs (January 2025)

✅ **Tournament Command Center Stats Bugs** (Fixed: January 2025)
- **Totals showing "undefined"**: Fixed missing W/L initialization in totals object
- **Player stats not populating on Roster tab**: ✅ **FIXED** - Refactored Tournament mode to match Franchise pattern exactly
  - `loadRoster()` now merges stats from tournament document into roster data (matches Franchise pattern)
  - `renderRoster()` now calls `renderRosterStats()` internally (matches Franchise `renderTeam()` pattern)
  - Removed old `renderStats()` function that used separate stats array
  - Updated HTML to use `roster-stats-body` instead of `stats-body` (matches Franchise)
- **Team stats container scroll issue**: Fixed by removing `scroll-x` wrapper and using inline overflow styling
- **Teams from user's game not populating on Stats tab**: ✅ **FIXED** - Now using shared `TeamStatsTable` module (same as Franchise)
- **Note**: Computer teams showing 2 games is a backend issue (likely double finalization) - needs backend investigation

✅ **Team Stats SS&S Refactoring** (Completed: January 2025)
- **Frontend**: Extracted shared `teamStatsTable.js` module (~160 lines of duplicate code removed)
  - Both Tournament and Franchise modes now use `TeamStatsTable.renderTeamStatsTable()` and `TeamStatsTable.sortTeamStats()`
  - Removed unnecessary roster refresh logic from Tournament `refreshTeamStats()`
- **Backend**: Extracted shared `team_stats_aggregator.py` utility (~130 lines of duplicate code removed)
  - Both Tournament and Franchise endpoints now use `aggregate_team_stats_from_players()`
  - Single source of truth for team stats aggregation logic
- **Total Reduction**: ~290 lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **Benefits**: One fix applies to both modes, prevents future bugs, ensures consistent behavior

✅ **Tournament Mode Roster/Stats Refactoring** (Completed: January 2025)
- **Refactored to match Franchise pattern exactly**: Tournament mode now uses identical code structure as Franchise mode
  - `loadRoster()`: Loads roster, loads tournament doc, merges stats into roster data (matches Franchise exactly)
  - `renderRoster()`: Calls `renderRosterStats()` internally (matches Franchise `renderTeam()` pattern)
  - Removed old `renderStats()` and `renderStatsTable()` functions that used separate stats array
  - Updated HTML: Changed `stats-body` to `roster-stats-body` to match Franchise
  - **Result**: Tournament and Franchise modes now use the exact same execution pattern with only variable names different (`tournament_id` vs `franchise_id`, `tournament.players` vs `franchise.players`)
